# wagon anamaly detection
This project leverages the YOLOv8 object detection model to identify anomalies in railway wagons in real-time. Upon detecting an anomaly, the system immediately triggers an alert and sends a notification to a configured Telegram bot, enabling fast response and monitoring.
##  Key Features

- **Real-Time Video Processing** using OpenCV
-  **YOLOv8** for high-performance anomaly detection
- **Telegram Bot Integration** for instant alerts
-  Easily adaptable to live video feeds or recorded footage
-  Modular codebase for easy expansion and deployment
##  Use Case

Designed to monitor railway wagons in industrial environments or logistics yards to detect:
- Structural damages
- Missing parts
